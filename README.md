# Data_Analysis_with_Python_Certification
This holds my python projects used to obtain the Data Analysis with Python freeCodeCamp certification

## [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](/Mean-Variance-Standard_Deviation_Calculator)
Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## [Demographic Data Analyzer](/Demographic_Data_Analyzer)
In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## [Page View Time Series Visualizer](/Page_View_Time_Series_Visualizer)
For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## [Sea Level Predictor](/Sea_Level_Predictor)
You will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
